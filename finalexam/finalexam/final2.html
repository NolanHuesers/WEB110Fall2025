				<h1>More About Destiny</h1>
				<p>Upon logging in, you can chose 3 different classes. The Hunter, the Warlock, or the Titan</p>
				<h3>Hunter</h3>
				<p>The Hunters are the tactical, agile class. They rely on their stealth and prowess to take down their foes quickly and efficiently</p>

				<h3>Warlock</h3>
				<p>The Warlocks are the class of scholars. As their knowledge of light and darkness grows, so does their power and their control over it. Some say that due to Warlocks knowledge, they are the only ones who know true power</p>

				<h3>Titans</h3>
				<p>Titans are the bastion class. They are the ones on the front line. They protect humanity and it's people. They are the wall against which darkness breaks</p>

				<p>Now it wouldn't be a game without some enemies to fight, and destiny has no shortage on those. Some of which include:</p>
				<h3>The Hive</h3>
				<p>The Hive are a race that is billions of years old. They follow a religion called the sword logic that states those who deserve to exist, must prove their right to exist through combat. They have conquered dozens of civilizations and are now at humanity's doorstep trying to do the same<p>

				<h3>The Cabal</h3>
				<p>The Cabal are a warrior race who takes pride in their honor. They grow fat from strength and dominate their enemies.<p>

				<h3>The Fallen</h3>
				<p>The Fallen are scavengers. Trying to reclaim the glory that they had before their god abandoned them in the face of darkness. They are crafty and clever, waiting for humanity to slip up and take humanities place<p>
