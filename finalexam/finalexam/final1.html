				<h1>Destiny</h1>
			</header>
			<main>
				<p>Destiny is a universe where the protectors of humanity, the Guardians, blessed and given powers by the Traveler, fight invaders and forces of the Darkness for survival.</p>
				<p>It not only is a story of Good vs Evil, but it calls in interesting questions of what makes people good or evil. Is it the light or darkness that they wield? Or are those just tools for you to wield.</p>
				<img src="images/home.png" alt="Destiny Cover Art" class="home-image">
				<p>Bungie, the developers of Desiny, also developed:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Halo: Combat Evolved (2001)</li>
					<li>Halo 2 (2004)</li>
					<li>Halo 3 (2007)</li>
					<li>Halo 3: ODST (2009)</li>
					<li>Halo Reach (2010)</li>
					<li>Destiny (2014)</li>
					<li>Destiny 2 (2017)</li>
				<p>You can exert domination on your foes through activities called strikes where you infiltrate an enemies base and take out their leader or you can sharper yourself in the player vs player mode, The Crucible.</p>
				<p>For those brave enough, there are 6 man activiites that require communication, coordination, puzzle-solving, and execution to conquer. In them, you can encounter anything from Wish Dragons, Disciples of the Darkness, and other foes that will push you and your team to the limit. Conquer them, and you will be able to enjoy the spoils of your achievement.</p>
