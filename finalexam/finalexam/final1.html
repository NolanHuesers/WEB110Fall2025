				<h1>Destiny</h1>
				<p>Destiny is a Universe that calls the forces of darkness and the forces of the light to battle it out to see who will survive.</p>
				<p>It not only is a story of Good vs Evil, but it calls in interesting questions of what makes people good or evil. Is it the light or darkness that they wield? Or are those just tools for you to wield.</p>
				<img src="images/home.png" alt="Destiny Cover Art" class="home-image">
				<p>You can exert domination on your foes through activities called strikes where you infiltrate an enemies base and take out their leader or you can sharper yourself in the player vs player mode, The Crucible.</p>
